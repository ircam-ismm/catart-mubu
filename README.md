CataRT-MuBu is a collection of Max patches for corpus-based concatenative synthesis, audio mosaicing, descriptor analysis, transcription, and composition.

CataRT is a technology devoted to structuring sound grains obtained from large sound data bases of any kind according to sound characteristics automatically analyzed and chosen by the user.
