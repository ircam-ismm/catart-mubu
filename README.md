# CataRT-MuBu

CataRT-MuBu is a collection of Max patches for corpus-based concatenative synthesis, audio mosaicing, descriptor analysis, transcription, and composition.

CataRT is a technology devoted to structuring sound grains obtained from large sound data bases of any kind according to sound characteristics automatically analyzed and chosen by the user. 
Thus, sound databases and archives may be explored quickly and intuitively for use in the areas of musical composition, sound design, live performance and improvisation.
